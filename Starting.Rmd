Following is what it needs to be done when we will have *Hymenochirus* sequences (mother+father).

# Before assembling

## Quality of the sequences

```
fastqc -o [location/name of the output] [location/name of the input] 
fastqc -o /home/evanslab/Hymeno_fastqc /net/infofile2/2/scratch/evanslab_backups/Hymenochirus_2016/TCAG_20160129/160106_E00389_0017_AHK3LJCCXX/*.fastq.gz
```
## Run trimmomatic on the sequences 
We use the same script as for the [tetraploid project](https://github.com/caro46/Tetraploid_project/blob/master/quality_tests.Rmd) (phred quality detected = phred33).
+ check the quality again.

##Use Quake or Reptile 

Estimate the genome size using k-mers (size =  total length of used reads divided by sequencing depth) + TE proportion

G = (N × (L – K + 1) – B)/D (from [Lamichhaney et al. 2016](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n1/fig_tab/ng.3430_SF1.html))

> Where:
>
> - G = genome size
>
> - N = total count of used reads (we can fgrep function)
>
> - L = length of used reads (can use grep function)
>
> - K = k-mer length
>
> - B = total count of low-frequency (frequency ≤1) k-mers that are probably caused by sequencing errors
>
> - D = sequencing depth

D & B can be estimated after ploting the histogram `histo` from jellyfish.

+ compare histo of female and male to check if difference in the amount of kmer counts (difference peaks size)

## Use TEDNA software ([Zytnicki et al. 2014](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/18/2656.long)) to identify TE?
