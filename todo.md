# Plan:

- *X. gilli* / *X. laevis* 
- [x] sequence submission - 16S + nfil1 still need to be corrected and submitted (issue with codon stop for 16S, nfil1 some warnings - can be submitted like that but better to try resolving them)
  
- HiSeqX from *Pipa* dad, mom and *Rhyno*: 
- [ ] Copy 
- [ ] Check quality 
- [ ] Trimmo + Jellifish/Quake
- [ ] Assemblies

- RADseq from *Pipa* dad, mom
- [x] Copy 
- [x] Check quality - some over-represented sequences
- [x] Demultiplex (installing the newest version of stacks that requires a newer version of gcc) 

- Hymenochirus Sex-linked regions
- [x] Extraction
- [ ] PCR
- [ ] Sequencing

*To do also as soon as possible (in case we need Mark's help)*
- *Mellotropicalis* 
- [x] Installing DBG2OLC on sharcnet (Ben's account)
- [ ] Assembling with DBG2OLC using pacbio sequences and the assembly (contigs, not scaffolds) previously made with Allpaths-LG (in theory Allpaths should have better assembly in term of confidence in the real contigs)
