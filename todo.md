# Plan:

- *X. gilli* / *X. laevis* 
- [x] sequence submission - 16S + nfil1 still need to be corrected and submitted (issue with codon stop for 16S, nfil1 some warnings - can be submitted like that but better to try resolving them)
  
- HiSeqX from *Pipa* dad, mom and *Rhyno*: 
- [ ] Copy 
- [ ] Check quality 
- [ ] Trimmo + Jellifish/Quake
- [ ] Assemblies

- Hymenochirus Sex-linked regions
- [ ] Extraction
- [ ] PCR
- [ ] Sequencing
