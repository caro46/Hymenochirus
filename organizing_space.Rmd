Here is where I archived some of the files that I want to keep until the paper submission - then they can be deleted after if I didn't directly use them in the paper.

Copying with `scp -r` from Brian's machine `/4/evanslab/Hymenochirus_2016/BWA_outputs/abyss_genomes/abyss_small_contigs/` to Sharcnet.
```
tar -czvf /archive/cauretc/Hymenochirus_2016_bwa_abyss_small_contigs.tar.gz /archive/cauretc/abyss_small_contigs/* --remove-files
tar -ztvf Hymenochirus_2016_bwa_abyss_small_contigs.tar.gz #checking all the files are here
```

Copying results from jellifish from `/4/evanslab/Hymenochirus_2016/jellyfish_Hymeno.tar.gz` to my Sharcnet archive (checked it was the same size with `ls -lh` then deleted from Brian's machine).

Copying `/4/evanslab/Hymenochirus_2016/BWA_outputs/tropicalis/` to `archive` and then
```
tar -czvf /archive/cauretc/Hymenochirus_2016_bwa_tropicalis_v9.tar.gz /archive/cauretc/tropicalis/* --remove-files
```

22/03/18: Deleting unnecessary (anymore and for now) files, that can be obtained again later on without wasting too much time:

- from `/4/evanslab/Hymenochirus_2016/BWA_outputs/abyss_genomes/abyss_small_contigs`: `abyssBJE3814_depth_BJE3814_BJE3815.depth` `abyssBJE3815_depth_BJE3815_BJE3814.depth` ([commands](https://github.com/caro46/Hymenochirus/blob/master/Assembly.Rmd))

- from `/4/evanslab/Hymenochirus_2016/BWA_outputs/SOAP_genome`: `SOAPchimereBJE3814_BJE3815_depth_reads_BJE3814_BJE3815.depth`

- from `/4/caroline/2017_Pipoidea_Hiseq/jellyfish/after_scythe/`: `BJE4294_jelly_dump_19mers.gz` `BJE4295_jelly_dump_19mers.gz` `CSL6209_jelly_dump_19mers.gz` ([commands](https://github.com/caro46/Pipa_parva/blob/master/preparing_pipa_data.md#jellyfishquake))
